My first story: About two weeks ago, we had the first outcome session in General Assembly (GA). Joy asked everybody in the class "what are you most proud of yourself?" I said I am proud of myself because I am a hardworking person. Yesterday, I thought about it again and I found another reason I am proud of myself; I QUIT the job that I did not enjoy. I did not like my previous job and I am very happy for myself that decided to quit and start a new path in my life.
When I decided to register to this program, it was scary at first, because I worked in a different field for about one and half years, no coding, no research, and I had forgotten a lot of things. Now, I am happy that I decided to register since I enjoy every moment of doing coding.
