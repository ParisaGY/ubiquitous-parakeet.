About two weeks ago, we had a first outcome session in General Assembly (GA).  Joy asked everybody in the class "what are you most proud of yourself?" I answered I am proud of myself because I am a hardworking person. Yesterday, I thought about it again and I found another answer I am proud of myself because I stoped doing the job that I did not enjoy.I did not like my previous job and I am very happy for myself that decided to stop it and start a new path in my life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I decided to register to this program, it was scary at that moment, because I worked in a different field for about one and half years, no coding, no research, and I forgot a lot of things. Now, I am happy that I decided to register because I enjoy every moment of doing coding.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
